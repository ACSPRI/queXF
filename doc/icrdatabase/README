In this directory are 3 example databases generated by ACSPRI. They may or may not work for you. They are based on handwritten character samples from many sources (many survey forms) written in English. Some testing has been done but none as to accuracy. It is always best to generate your own database with your own training data to get the best results.

Here are the details of how many samples used to generate each character in each file:
