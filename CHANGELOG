queXF 1.11.3 - Changes since queXF 1.11.2

*Fixed Bug: testconfig failing where options are given to GS
*Fixed Bug: duplicate barcode data output if not first element

queXF 1.11.2 - Changes since queXF 1.11.1

*Fixed Bug: CSV output where barcode/longtext not outputting if first element in data
*Fixed Bug: testconfig script did not appear in index and failed as not referencing lang.inc.php
*New feature: testconfig now default default page and tests for directory based authentication and common settings

queXF 1.11.1 - Changes since queXF 1.11.0

*Fixed Bug: Verification boxes appear in wrong spot when original page form size differs to scan

queXF 1.11.0 - Changes since queXF 1.10.2

*Fixed Bug: Cannot verify when barcode selected on page
*Fixed Bug: Barcode tolerance is set to as close as possible

*Added new feature: Page setup now on a form by form basis - only requirement
is that the area of a page where a barcode belongs is specified 
(see BARCODE_TLX_PORTION, BARCODE_TLY_PORTION..etc), and that the
barcode length (see BARCODE_LENGTH_PID) is specified.

Once queXF detects the barcode it uses the stored page location details to
determine the page edges.

Page setup is now part of the form importation process.

Here are the changes required to the database from the previous version:

queXF 1.10.1 - Changes since 1.10.0

Fixed bug: Error when creating new questionnaire without banding XML

queXF 1.10.0 - Changes since 1.9.1:

queXF 1.10.0 and the simultaneous release of queXML 1.3.0 streamlines the paper questionnaire creation process by being able to produce a fully banded questionnaire from queXML. Once the PDF and associated banding XML file is imported to queXF, it is possible to begin scanning completed forms immediately, and export data with full question and value labelling from the original queXML file.

In addition, queXF 1.10.0 allows for the export of unverified data. This may be useful when your settings allow for very accurate OMR and also to view preliminary results before operator verification is complete.

In the backend - queXF 1.10.0 removes the need for using database views and some redundant tables.

Summary of SVN Log:

*Updated translation file and translations from Launchpad
*Added ability to download data that is not verified (just imported and OMR/OCR'ed)
*Updated database schema - removed use of views
*Added new test documents including banding XML document
*Updated default settings to allow for wider selections on A4 pages by default
*Updated default box colour to blue which assisted with colour blindness
*Added ability to import banding XML while importing a PDF file
*Removed references to boxgroups table which was redundant
*Data output now includes labels and sections/etc if banding XML is used
*BUG fix: Gave default value of 0 for 'sheets' column in questionnaires table
*BUG fix: Will not create a new questionnaire if cannot detect all page edges
*BUG fix: Will not apply transforms if not all edges detected
*BUG fix: Made sure boxes are processed in sortorder (javascript edit)
