#queXF

An Open Source, web based paper form verification and data entry system

queXF takes scanned paper forms generated using queXML and reads them. Operators then verify that queXF has read the form correctly using a web browser. The data collected can be exported to DDI, CSV or statistical packages.

queXF can be used as a web based, Open Source alternative to programs such as Cardiff Teleform and Remark OMR, in some situations. It can be used as a CADE (Computer Assisted Data Entry) tool.

queXF removes the need to manually enter form data, therefore reducing error and fatigue. queXF does OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) on each form to determine if boxes have been filled. A verifier (using a web browser) will then confirm that the entered fields are correct, and also enter any character data.

Operators need little knowledge of the form design as queXF breaks down the verification task in to a question by question process. The operator works in a web browser and does not need to install any other software on their computer, therefore can work from any location with network access.

Development for queXF occurs on Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/quexf
